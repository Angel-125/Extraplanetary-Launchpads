refurbish
	Solid Fuel
	Ablator
	Parachutes
	... (resources with resource recipes)
	Part upgrades (can upgrade to a craft file with a similar enough parts list)

somehow mark parts as not being buildable
	requested by lgg

rebalance converters DONE
	use LFO (+EC?) to power smelter
		assuming LF is RP-1, the mix seems to be pretty good for supplying
		the needed carbon and about half the heat energy.
	use resource recipes (converter recipes?)

disposable pad DONE
	works like a normal pad except:
		it is destroyed when the build is finalized
		the build is permanently attached to the previous location of the pad
			use root part
				require stack node
					use top node
				use "roll" of pad part to determine roll of build's root part

recycler
	pause instead of dump
	capture but don't recycle (+release?)
	reduce randomness with upgrades

structural material
refractory material
transparent material

I once said that if @taniwha decided that Ore -> RubberChickens ->RocketParts was the resource chain, I'd adopt it

12:45Electrocutor: You would place a surveyor tripod on the ground, then use it to bring up an interface where you select the vessel and get the displacement and rotation controls you get like when in the VAB. Once it's where you want, you finish and it auto-places stakes at the bounding box points. This way it removes the manual x,z stuff needed for the current stakes and you know which way and where your thing will be built.
